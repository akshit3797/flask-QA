Molecular Location: base pairs 49,015,980 to 49,017,090 on chromosome 19 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

From NCBI Gene: LH is expressed in the pituitary gland and promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation by stimulating the testes and ovaries to synthesize steroids.
This gene is a member of the glycoprotein hormone beta chain family and encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH). Glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers consisting of a common alpha subunit and an unique beta subunit which confers biological specificity. LH is expressed in the pituitary gland and promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation by stimulating the testes and ovaries to synthesize steroids. The genes for the beta chains of chorionic gonadotropin and for luteinizing hormone are contiguous on chromosome 19q13.3. Mutations in this gene are associated with hypogonadism which is characterized by infertility and pseudohermaphroditism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Required for ovarian folliculogenesis. Promotes primordial follicle development. Stimulates granulosa cell proliferation. Promotes cell transition from G0/G1 to S and G2/M phases, through an increase of CCND1 and CCNE1 expression, and RB1 phosphorylation. It regulates STAR expression and cAMP-dependent progesterone release in granulosa and thecal cells. Attenuates the suppressive effects of activin A on STAR expression and progesterone production by increasing the expression of inhibin B. It suppresses FST and FSTL3 production in granulosa-lutein cells.

HSD3B2 gene
hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 2
Within these hormone-producing tissues, the 3β-HSD enzyme is necessary for the production of many hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, androgens, and estrogen. 

Cytogenetic Location: 1p12, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 at position 12
Molecular Location: base pairs 119,414,931 to 119,423,039 on chromosome 1 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The HSD3B2 gene provides instructions for making the 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) enzyme. This enzyme is found in the gonads, which are the ovaries in females and testes in males, and in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. Within these hormone-producing tissues, the 3β-HSD enzyme is necessary for the production of many hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, androgens, and estrogen. Cortisol has numerous functions such as maintaining energy and blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidney. The retention of salt affects fluid levels and blood pressure. Androgens and estrogen are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction.


CYP17A1 gene
cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1
This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen
Cytogenetic Location: 10q24.32, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 at position 24.32
Molecular Location: base pairs 102,830,531 to 102,837,533 on chromosome 10 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The CYP17A1 gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family. Like other cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP17A1 is involved in the formation (synthesis) of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar levels and regulating the body's response to stress.
Steroid hormones are synthesized through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. The enzyme has 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, converting pregnenalone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. These hormone precursors are further processed to produce glucocorticoids and sex hormones. CYP17A1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which converts 17-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This reaction is integral to the production of sex hormones.

CYP19A1 gene
cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1
In females, aromatase is most active in the ovaries, where it guides sexual development.
Cytogenetic Location: 15q21.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.2
Molecular Location: base pairs 51,208,057 to 51,338,598 on chromosome 15 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The CYP19A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of the female sex hormone estrogen.
In cells, aromatase is found in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The activity (expression) of aromatase varies among different cell types depending on the cells' need for estrogen. In females, aromatase is most active in the ovaries, where it guides sexual development. In males, aromatase is most active in fat (adipose) tissue. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood sugar levels. During fetal development, aromatase converts androgens to estrogens in the placenta, which is the link between the mother's blood supply and the fetus. This conversion in the placenta prevents androgens from directing sexual development in female fetuses. After birth, the conversion of androgens to estrogens takes place in multiple tissues.


LHCGR gene
luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor
  In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovaries (ovulation); chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue.                                                                                                Cytogenetic Location: 2p16.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 2 at position 16.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 48,686,774 to 48,755,741 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)



The LHCGR gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein called the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.
The protein produced from the LHCGR gene acts as a receptor for two ligands: luteinizing hormone and a similar hormone called chorionic gonadotropin. The receptor allows the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. In males, chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the development of cells in the testes called Leydig cells, and luteinizing hormone triggers these cells to produce androgens. Androgens, including testosterone, are the hormones that control male sexual development and reproduction. In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovaries (ovulation); chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue.



WNT4 gene
Wnt family member 4
 This protein is also involved in development of the ovaries, from before birth through adulthood, and is important for development and maintenance of egg cells (oocytes) in the ovaries. In addition, the WNT4 protein regulates the production of male sex hormones (androgens).

 Cytogenetic Location: 1p36.12, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 at position 36.12
Molecular Location: base pairs 22,117,305 to 22,143,981 on chromosome 1 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The WNT4 gene belongs to a family of WNT genes that play critical roles in development before birth. WNT genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body. These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development.
The WNT4 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is important for the formation of the female reproductive system, the kidneys, and several hormone-producing glands. During the development of the female reproductive system, the WNT4 protein regulates the formation of the Müllerian ducts, which are structures in the embryo that develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and the upper part of the vagina. This protein is also involved in development of the ovaries, from before birth through adulthood, and is important for development and maintenance of egg cells (oocytes) in the ovaries. In addition, the WNT4 protein regulates the production of male sex hormones (androgens).


NR5A1 gene
nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1
Steroidogenic factor 1 helps control the activity of several genes related to the development of the gonads (ovaries and testes) 

Cytogenetic Location: 9q33.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 33.3

 Normal Function

The NR5A1 gene provides instructions for producing a transcription factor called the steroidogenic factor 1. A transcription factor is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Steroidogenic factor 1 helps control the activity of several genes related to the development of the gonads 
(ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney.

LIMK1 gene

Cytogenetic Location: 7q11.23, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 11.23
Molecular Location: base pairs 74,083,777 to 74,122,525 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The LIMK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is highly active in the brain, where it is thought to be involved in the development of nerve cells. Studies suggest that this protein may play an important role in areas of the brain that are responsible for processing visual-spatial information (visuospatial constructive cognition). These parts of the brain are important for visualizing an object as a set of parts and performing tasks such as writing, drawing, constructing models, and assembling puzzles.
Within cells, the LIMK1 protein likely regulates aspects of the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement. The LIMK1 protein helps control the organization of actin filaments, which are long, thin fibers that make up a significant part of the cytoskeleton. Actin filaments are necessary for several normal cellular functions, such as cell division, cell movement (motility), maintenance of cell shape, transport of proteins and other molecules within cells, and chemical signaling between cells.
