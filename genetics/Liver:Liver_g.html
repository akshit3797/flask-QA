patatin like phospholipase domain containing 3

Cytogenetic Location: 22q13.31, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 13.31
Molecular Location: base pairs 43,923,739 to 43,947,568 on chromosome 22 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The PNPLA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called adiponutrin, which is found in fat cells (adipocytes) and liver cells (hepatocytes). The function of the is thought to help regulate the development of adipocytes and the production and breakdown of fats (lipogenesis and lipolysis) in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Studies indicate that the activity (expression) of the PNPLA3 gene decreases during periods without food (fasting) and increases after eating, suggesting that the amount of adiponutrin protein produced is regulated as needed to help process and store fats in the diet.

Molecular Location: base pairs 18,892,298 to 18,984,362 on the X chromosome (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The alpha-2 subunit produced from the PHKA2 gene is part of the enzyme found in the liver.
Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. At least 90 mutations in the PHKA2 gene are known to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) called GSD IXa or X-linked liver glycogenosis (XLG). This is the most common form of GSD IX, accounting for approximately 75 percent of cases. GSD IXa affects liver function, and its characteristic features include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), slow growth, and periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Mutations in the PHKA2 gene reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in liver cells.

HAMP gene
hepcidin antimicrobial peptide
Molecular Location: base pairs 35,282,346 to 35,285,143 on chromosome 19 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
Cytogenetic Location: 19q13.12, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.12


 Normal Function

The HAMP gene provides instructions for the production of a protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin was originally identified as having antimicrobial properties, which refers to the ability of this protein to fight bacterial infections. Hepcidin is then released into the bloodstream and travels throughout the body. This protein interacts primarily with other proteins in the intestines, liver, and certain white blood cells to adjust iron absorption and storage. In this way, iron supplies are monitored and iron absorption is adjusted to reflect the needs of an individual's body.

Cytogenetic Location: 18q21.31, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 at position 21.31
Molecular Location: base pairs 57,646,426 to 57,803,822 on chromosome 18 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The ATP8B1 gene (also known as FIC1) provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. It is thought to control the distribution of certain fat molecules known as aminophospholipids on the inner surface of liver cell membranes. In particular, this protein performs its function in the membranes of liver cells that transport fat-digesting acids called bile acids into bile, and it likely plays a role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids.

SEPSECS gene
Sep (O-phosphoserine) tRNA:Sec (selenocysteine) tRNA synthase

Cytogenetic Location: 4p15.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 at position 15.2
Molecular Location: base pairs 25,120,005 to 25,160,582 on chromosome 4 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The SEPSECS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as SepSecS. This particular tRNA plays a critical role in the production of a protein building block (amino acid) called selenocysteine (Sec). Selenocysteine contains the chemical element selenium, which is an essential nutrient obtained from the diet.
Proteins that contain selenocysteine are called selenoproteins. Selenoproteins also play a role in turning on (activating) thyroid hormones and are involved in immune system function and the production of sperm cells. 

TFR2 gene
transferrin receptor 2
 
Cytogenetic Location: 7q22.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 22.1
Molecular Location: base pairs 100,620,416 to 100,642,780 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The TFR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transferrin receptor 2. Studies suggest that this receptor helps iron enter liver cells (hepatocytes). In the blood, iron binds to a protein called transferrin for transport and delivery to the liver and other tissues. On the cell surface, transferrin binds to transferrin receptor 2, and iron is allowed to enter the cell. Additionally, this receptor helps sense and regulate iron storage levels in the body by controlling the levels of another protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin is a protein that determines how much iron is absorbed from the diet and released from storage sites in the body in response to iron levels.

AKR1D1 gene
aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1
Cytogenetic Location: 7q33, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 33
Molecular Location: base pairs 138,076,432 to 138,118,304 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The AKR1D1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-oxo-5-beta(β)-steroid 4-dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in liver cells. It participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme is responsible for the third step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one.

ATPase copper transporting beta
Cytogenetic Location: 13q14.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 13 at position 14.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 51,932,669 to 52,012,130 on chromosome 13 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found primarily in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys and brain. It plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for the removal of excess copper from the body.
If copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile.

cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase

Cytogenetic Location: 7q11.23, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 11.23
Molecular Location: base pairs 75,915,102 to 75,986,855 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The POR gene provides instructions for making the enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. This enzyme is required for the normal functioning of more than 50 enzymes in the cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the formation (synthesis) and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells.
Additionally, cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of ingested substances, such as medications, in the liver. Because cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase helps regulate the activity of these enzymes, researchers suspect that normal variations in the POR gene may influence a person's response to particular drugs (drug metabolism).
