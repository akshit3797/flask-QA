Members of the same family of biogenic amines: They share a common precursor, tyrosine, and a common biosynthetic pathway. Dopamine is the hormone that allows induces the feelings of happiness, pain, mood, emotion, pleasure, and energy.  Tyrosine is converted to L-dopa by tyrosine hydroxylase, and L-dopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase. If dopamine beta-hydroxylase is present in the nerve terminal, dopamine is converted to norepinephrine. If phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT) is present with SAM-e as the methyl donor, then norepinephrine is methylated to form epinephrine. Dopaminergic neurons secrete dopamine because the presynaptic nerve terminal contains tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa decarboxylase, but not the other enzymes. Andrenergic neurons secrete norepinephrine because they contain dopamine beta-hydroxylase, in addition to tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa decarboxylase, but not PNMT. The adrenal medulla contains the complete enzymatic pathway; therefore, it secretes primarily epinephrine.
