1. Lemon Balm- Inhibits the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from attaching to receptors and blocks the synthesis of T4, prevents the conversion of T4 to T3, dilutes the effects of TSH, and prevents antibodies from accelerating the functioning of the thyroid. 
<br>*   Take at least 300-500 mg daily.

2. Motherwort- Eradicates the symptoms of Gravesâ€™ disease, the most common reason for hyperthyroidism. It slows the heart rate, strengthens the heart, and decreases restlessness. It acts as a natural beta blocker by controlling heart rhythm and getting rid of palpitations.
<br>*   2g 1x daily
<br><br>
3. L-Carnitine- L-Carnitine reverses hyperthyroidism by preventing both thyroxine and triiodothyronine from entering the cell nuclei. This is important because thyroid hormones must enter the cell nucleus in order to cause the problems commonly associated with hyperthyroidism.
L-Carnitine hyperthyroid supplements can reverse hyperthyroid symptoms, prevent, and minimize the appearance of those symptoms. L-Carnitine is also used in the most severe form of hyperthyroidism.
<br>*   500mg 3x daily
<br><br>
3. Bugleweed- Decelerates the metabolism of iodine, decreasing the hormone created by the cells in the afflicted thyroid gland. The lithospermic acid in the supplement also reduces the level of thyroxine, bringing about relief from symptoms. Bugleweed can also minimize irregular palpitations.
<br>*   1-2g 1x daily
<br><br>
4. Ashwagandha- Can slow production of T3.
<br>*   500-1,000mg 2x daily

5. B complex- Assists in DNA/RNA methylation cycle which reacts with thyroid hormones from becoming both hypo or hyper.
