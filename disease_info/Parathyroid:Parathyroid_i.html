The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands, located in the neck, that control the body's calcium levels. The chief cells synthesize and secrete PTH which then synthesizes the ribosomes as preproPTH, Peptite bonds proPTH, then is transported to the Golgi apparatus.  When the blood calcium level is too low, PTH (parathyroid hormone) is released to bring the calcium level back up to normal. When the calcium level is normal or gets a little too high, normal parathyroids will stop releasing PTH. Proper calcium and phosphorus balance is crucial to the normal functioning of the heart, nervous system, kidneys, and bones. Chronic hypocalcemia (decreased plasma Ca2+ concentration) causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by increased synthesis and storage of PTH, and hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. On the other hand, chronic hypercalcemia causes decreases synthesis and storage of PTH, increased breakdown of stored PTH, and release of inactive PTH.
