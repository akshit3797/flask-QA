1. Milk Thistle- The active compound silymarin acts as a seal on the surface of liver cells and thus prevents harmful substances to penetrate into the cell interior. It also enhances the ability to regenerate the liver resulting in faster recovery and a more efficient processing of toxins and red blood cells.
2. NAC- A delivery form of L-cysteine, which serves as a major precursor to glutathione. A major role of glutathione is the maintenance of a normal redox state of the liver, which is vital to normal hepatic function. NAC’s mucolytic activity is due to its ability to reduce disulfide bonds in mucoproteins found in mucus, liquefying this viscous substance. NAC has improved myocardial contraction of myocardial ischemia. Inhibits platelet aggregation and lowers lipoprotein levels. 
3. Bupleurum- Saikosaponins found in bupleurum stimulate corticosteroid production, thus increasing the anti-inflammatory effects. Inhibits the growth of liver cancer cells and increases hepatic protein. 
4. Dandelion root- Promotes the formation of bile and removes excess water from the body in edemous conditions resulting from liver damage. 
5. Calcium-d glucarate- Metabolizes excess estrogen in the liver. A major mechanism for the detoxification of certain carcinogens is via glucuronidation, which is catalyzed by glucuronyl transferase. The glucuronide conjugates are excreted in the urine and bile. 
6. SAM-e- Prevents fatty oxidation in liver and is a precursor for glutathione.
7. NADH- Prevents and decreases fatty oxidation in the liver and signals the conditions are right for fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerols accumulate in the liver, leading to fatty liver disease.  Liver mitochondria converts acetate into acetyl CoA in a reaction requiring ATP. The enzyme is the thiokinase that normally activates short-chain fatty acids.
8. Choline- Effective more so in Krebs cycle. Choline is crucial for the maintenance of cell-membrane fluidity and cellular integrity. 
9. Alpha lipoic acid- Most of the metabolic reactions in which alpha-lipoic acid participates occur in the mitochondria. These include the oxidation of pyruvic acid by the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex and the oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate. Exogenous alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to increase ATP production and aortic blood flow during reoxygenation after hypoxia in a working heart model. This is due to its role in the oxidation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria. 
10. Burdock root- Contains phenolic acids, quercetin, and luteolin- all powerful antioxidants that help protect your body from free radicals. They work by helping push toxins out and by boosting the ability of the liver to remove toxins.
