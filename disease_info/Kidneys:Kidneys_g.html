<u><b>GLIS2 gene </u>: </b>GLIS family zinc finger 2
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 16p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 4,314,761 to 4,339,597 on chromosome 16 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

This gene is a member of the GLI-similar zinc finger protein family and encodes a nuclear transcription factor with five C2H2-type zinc finger domains. The protein encoded by this gene is widely expressed at low levels in the neural tube and peripheral nervous system and likely promotes neuronal differentiation. It is abundantly expressed in the kidney and may have a role in the regulation of kidney morphogenesis. p120 regulates the expression level of this protein and induces the cleavage of this protein's C-terminal zinc finger domain. This protein also promotes the nuclear translocation of p120. Mutations in this gene cause nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive kidney disease characterized by tubular basement membrane disruption, interstitial lymphohistiocytic cell infiltration, and development of cysts at the corticomedullary.

<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 215,360,440 to 215,436,167 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The FN1 gene provides instructions for making two types of the fibronectin-1 protein: soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and insoluble cellular fibronectin-1. Both types of fibronectin-1 help individual cells expand (spread) and move (migrate) to cover more space and also influence cell shape and maturation (differentiation). At least three mutations in the FN1 gene have been found to cause fibronectin glomerulopathy, a progressive kidney disease that usually begins in adulthood and results in irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).

<u><b>PKD1 gene </u>: </b>polycystin 1, transient receptor potential channel interacting

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 16p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 2,088,708 to 2,135,898 on chromosome 16 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The PKD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-1. This protein is most active in kidney cells before birth; much less of the protein is made in normal adult kidneys
Polycystin-1 is also found in cell structures called primary cilia. Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules). Researchers believe that primary cilia sense the movement of fluid through these tubules, which appears to help maintain the tubules' size and structure. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.

<u><b>SLC12A1 gene </u>: </b>solute carrier family 12 member 1


<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 15q21.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 48,206,301 to 48,304,078 on chromosome 15 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The SLC12A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as NKCC2. This protein is a Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter, which means that it moves charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chlorine (Cl-) into cells.
The NKCC2 protein is essential for normal kidney function. The NKCC2 protein works with other transport proteins to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. Together, these proteins provide the mechanism by which kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.

<u><b>SLC34A1 gene </u>: </b>solute carrier family 34 member 1

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 5q35.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 35.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 177,384,431 to 177,412,021 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The SLC34A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels in the body (phosphate homeostasis). The NaPi-IIa protein is located in the membrane surrounding kidney cells, where it transports phosphate across the cell membrane. NaPi-IIa reabsorbs phosphate from urine back into the body when more of the mineral is needed.

<u><b>ATP6V1B1 gene </u>: </b>ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B1

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 2p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 2 at position 13.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 70,935,868 to 70,965,431 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can "donate" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment
The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V1B1 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).

<u><b>PKD2 gene </u>: </b>polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : <br> 4q22.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 22.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 88,007,647 to 88,077,779 on chromosome 4 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 <br><br>Normal Function : <br>

The PKD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-2. This protein is found in the kidneys before birth and in many adult tissues.
Polycystin-2 likely functions as a channel spanning the cell membrane of kidney cells. In conjunction with polycystin-1, the channel transports positively charged atoms (ions), particularly calcium ions, into the cell. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely work together to help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and interactions with other cells. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.
