GLIS2 gene
GLIS family zinc finger 2
Cytogenetic Location: 16p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 4,314,761 to 4,339,597 on chromosome 16 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

This gene is a member of the GLI-similar zinc finger protein family and encodes a nuclear transcription factor with five C2H2-type zinc finger domains. The protein encoded by this gene is widely expressed at low levels in the neural tube and peripheral nervous system and likely promotes neuronal differentiation. It is abundantly expressed in the kidney and may have a role in the regulation of kidney morphogenesis. p120 regulates the expression level of this protein and induces the cleavage of this protein's C-terminal zinc finger domain. This protein also promotes the nuclear translocation of p120. Mutations in this gene cause nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive kidney disease characterized by tubular basement membrane disruption, interstitial lymphohistiocytic cell infiltration, and development of cysts at the corticomedullary.

Cytogenetic Location: 9p13.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 9 at position 13.2
Molecular Location: base pairs 37,422,435 to 37,438,952 on chromosome 9 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The GRHPR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in preventing the buildup of a potentially harmful substance called glyoxylate.

FN1 gene
fibronectin 1

Cytogenetic Location: 2q35, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 35
Molecular Location: base pairs 215,360,440 to 215,436,167 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The FN1 gene provides instructions for making two types of the fibronectin-1 protein: soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and insoluble cellular fibronectin-1. Both types of fibronectin-1 help individual cells expand (spread) and move (migrate) to cover more space and also influence cell shape and maturation (differentiation). At least three mutations in the FN1 gene have been found to cause fibronectin glomerulopathy, a progressive kidney disease that usually begins in adulthood and results in irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).  

WT1 gene
Wilms tumor 1

Cytogenetic Location: 11p13, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 at position 13
Molecular Location: base pairs 32,387,775 to 32,435,539 on chromosome 11 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The WT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is necessary for the development of the kidneys and gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) before birth. After birth, WT1 protein activity is limited to a structure known as the glomerulus, which filters blood through the kidneys.

PKD1 gene
polycystin 1, transient receptor potential channel interacting

Cytogenetic Location: 16p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 2,088,708 to 2,135,898 on chromosome 16 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The PKD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-1. This protein is most active in kidney cells before birth; much less of the protein is made in normal adult kidneys
Polycystin-1 is also found in cell structures called primary cilia. Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules). Researchers believe that primary cilia sense the movement of fluid through these tubules, which appears to help maintain the tubules' size and structure. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys. 
SLC12A1 gene
solute carrier family 12 member 1


Cytogenetic Location: 15q21.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.1
Molecular Location: base pairs 48,206,301 to 48,304,078 on chromosome 15 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The SLC12A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as NKCC2. This protein is a Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter, which means that it moves charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chlorine (Cl-) into cells.
The NKCC2 protein is essential for normal kidney function. The NKCC2 protein works with other transport proteins to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. Together, these proteins provide the mechanism by which kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.

MUC1 gene
mucin 1, cell surface associated


Cytogenetic Location: 1q22, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 at position 22
Molecular Location: base pairs 155,185,824 to 155,192,915 on chromosome 1 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The MUC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mucin 1. This protein is one of several mucin proteins that make up mucus, a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. In addition to its role in mucus, mucin 1 is involved in cell signaling and kidney development.

SLC34A1 gene
solute carrier family 34 member 1

Cytogenetic Location: 5q35.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 35.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 177,384,431 to 177,412,021 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 

 Normal Function

The SLC34A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels in the body (phosphate homeostasis). The NaPi-IIa protein is located in the membrane surrounding kidney cells, where it transports phosphate across the cell membrane. NaPi-IIa reabsorbs phosphate from urine back into the body when more of the mineral is needed.

ATP6V1B1 gene
ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B1

Cytogenetic Location: 2p13.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 2 at position 13.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 70,935,868 to 70,965,431 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can "donate" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment
The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V1B1 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).

PKD2 gene
polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel

Cytogenetic Location: 4q22.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 4 at position 22.1
Molecular Location: base pairs 88,007,647 to 88,077,779 on chromosome 4 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The PKD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-2. This protein is found in the kidneys before birth and in many adult tissues.
Polycystin-2 likely functions as a channel spanning the cell membrane of kidney cells. In conjunction with polycystin-1, the channel transports positively charged atoms (ions), particularly calcium ions, into the cell. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely work together to help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and interactions with other cells. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.
