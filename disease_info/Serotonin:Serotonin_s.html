1. 5-HTP- Tryptophan more readily enters the brain, but 5-HTP requires one less step to convert into serotonin.

2. Melatonin- Serotonin is converted into melatonin in the brain’s pineal gland, the most serotonin-rich tissue in the in body. Within the pineal gland,** **serotonin is acetylated and then methylated to yield melatonin.

3. Tryptophan- Precursor to serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is synthesized into tryptophan.

4. St. John’s wort- Serotonin levels in the brain's hypothalamus and hippocampus are boosted 10 mg/kg body weight with St. John's wort. Hyperforin, the active ingredient in St.John’s wort, may play a major role in hypericum's action. Hypericum may enhance both 5-HT and noradrenaline transmission in the forebrain of the limbic brain circuits. Since this part of the brain controls mood, it could explain the antidepressant effects.

5. Acetyl-L-carnitine- Improves cellular energy production in the hypothalamus. Increases brain levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, and may regulate expression of the glutamate receptor, mGlu2.

6. SAM-e-  Both depressed and non-depressed people who supplement with SAMe have higher overall levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  SAMe speeds production of the receptors which receive these neurotransmitters. The presence of additional receptors allows the neurotransmitters that are present to work more effectively.

7. Zinc/B-6- Vitamin B6 must be present to facilitate the conversion of either 5-HTP or tryptophan into serotonin. Zinc facilitates in this process. It increases the uptake of serotonin in certain areas of the brain and shows potential as a treatment for major depressive disorder.
<br><br>
8. Glycine/D-Serine- It is possible that the increase in 5-HT in response to glycine and d-serine is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The transient increase in 5-HT in the Prefrontal cortex is associated with the alleviation of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and the amelioration of sleep quality in patients with insomnia.

9. L- theanine- L-theanine administrates growth on serotonin axons in the frontal and parietal lobes of the neocortex and limbic system, the part of the brain that regulates motivation and emotion. It has also been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models possibly through its antagonistic effects on group 1 metabotrophic glutamate receptors.

10. Saffron- Inhibits serotonin reuptake in synapses. Inhibiting synaptic serotonin reuptake keeps serotonin in the brain longer, thereby enhancing its positive effects while combating depression.
