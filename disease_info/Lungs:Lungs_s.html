  **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Recommended Supplements</span>**: 

1. L-arginine- Increases nitric oxide levels and induces bronchodilation. Considerably helpful in asthma patients. 
2. Ivy leaf- Prompts the bronchial mucosa to produce fluid mucus, which is easier to cough up and expands the smallest pulmonary alveoli via a complex biochemical process, which helps the oxygen supply to the lungs. The effect is referred to as an indirect “Beta2-mimetic” effect, which is also provided by some synthetic asthma treatments.
3. Mullein- Contains compounds act on the central nervous system to move phlegm out of the lungs. Stimulates the cough reflux, but not the endothelial hairs lining the respiratory passages.
4. Bromelain- Liquefies and decreases bronchial secretions. Prevents progression of sinusitis and bronchitis. 
5. Lobelia- Used as an expectorant and decongestant. lobelia stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine, in effect, this relaxes the airways and allows for easier breathing.
6. Quercetin- Relaxes bronchial passages.  A powerful anti-inflammatory helpful in fighting several types of lung disease.
7. Grapeseed extract- A high source of Oligomeric pro-anthocyanidins that prevents reactions provoked by airborne pathogens.
