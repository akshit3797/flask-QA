2. Ivy leaf- Prompts the bronchial mucosa to produce fluid mucus, which is easier to cough up and expands the smallest pulmonary alveoli via a complex biochemical process, which helps the oxygen supply to the lungs. The effect is referred to as an indirect “Beta2-mimetic” effect, which is also provided by some synthetic asthma treatments.
