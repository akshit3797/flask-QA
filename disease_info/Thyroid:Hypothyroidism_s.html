1. Bovine glandular- Thyroid extracts have putative activity in managing hypothyroidism. 
*   Dosages vary
2. Iodine- An essential trace element which is vital to the function of the thyroid gland. Iodine is accumulated in the thyroid by means of an active iodide transport mechanism which is catalyzed by a sodium-iodide symporter which mediates the sodium potassium ATPase dependent coupling of inward iodide and sodium fluxes. Aids in the development and functioning of the thyroid gland and is an integral part of T4. 
*   150mcg 1 daily
3. Tyrosine- Iodine reacts with tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. L-tyrosine is a precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, and the pigment melanin.
*   500mg-1,000mg 30 minutes before or after meals
4. Zinc- An essential trace mineral required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Zinc is involved in nucleic acid, protein metabolism and the production of energy associated with the thyroid. 
*   30mg 1x daily- Discontinue after thyroid levels normalized and focus on zinc rich food sources. 
5. Magnesium glycinate- Deficiency prevents production in thyroid hormones. This mineral helps your body make TSH (the hormone made in your Hypothalamus that tells your thyroid gland to make T4).
*   400mg 1x before bed

    6. Vitamin D- Allows T3 to communicate to your DNA to regulate metabolism.

*   2,000-5,000 IU 1 daily

    7. Vitamin C- Excessive iodine in the thyroidÂ may result in mitochondrial oxidative stress, which leads to a damage of thyrocytes.

*   2,000-3,000mg 1x daily

    8. Selenium- this mineral is responsible for converting T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) into T3 (active thyroid hormone).

*   200mcg 1 daily
9. B12- Deficiency can mimic low thyroid. This also works in conjunction with the other B vitamins to support natural thyroid hormone production. 
*   5mg for the first 2 weeks in mornings, then decrease to 2mg and continue until normal levels are restored. \


    10. B2- Helps transport iodine into T4

*   25mg 1x daily- Use synergistically with B12 or in a Bcomplex
