 The function of the small intestine are digestion and absorption of nutrients. Motility of the small intestine serves to mix the chyme with digestive enzymes and pancreatic secretions, expose the nutrients to the intestinal mucosa for absorption, and propel the unabsorbed chyme along the small intestine into the large intestine. After chewing your food, the bolus enters the stomach through the esophageal sphincter, commonly called the cardiac sphincter, which immediately closes to keep the bolus from sliding back into the esophagus. This is essential to prevent stomach acid from backing up, causing pain and tissue damage. Heartburn is the movement of acid from the stomach back into the esophagus.
