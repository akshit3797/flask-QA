The overall function of the sympathetic nervous system mobilizes energy stores in times of need. The sympathetic nervous system is activated with a response known as “fight-or-flight”, which includes increased arterial pressure, increased blood flow to activate muscles, increased metabolic rate, increased blood glucose concentration, and increased mental activity and alertness. Although this response is rarely employed, the sympathetic nervous system operates continuously to modulate the functions of many organ systems, such as heart, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, bronchi, and sweat glands. The preganglionic sympathetic neurons originate in nuclei of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, leave the spinal cord via the ventral motor roots and white rami, and project either to the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic chain or to a series of prevertebral ganglia. One category of preganglionic neuron synapses on postganglionic neurons within the sympathetic chain. These synapses may occur in ganglia at the same level of the chain.
