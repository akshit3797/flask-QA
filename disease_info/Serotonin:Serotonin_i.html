The neuroendocrine system consists of the nerve and gland cells by the hypothalamus that play a role in many physiological processes.  The neuroendocrine cells (neurons), and endocrine cells make up the nervous system that drives the other systems of the body such as mood, temperature, weight, and various hormones. The transmission of information at chemical synapses involves the release of a neurotransmitter from a presynaptic cell, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and binding of the neurotransmitter to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane to produce a change in membrane potential.

A biogenic amine, is produced from tryptophan in serotonergic neurons in the brain and in the G.I tract. Following its release from presynaptic neurons, serotonin may be returned intact to the nerve terminal, or it may be degraded in the presynaptic terminal by MAO to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Serotonin serves as a precursor to melatonin in the pineal gland. Roughly 85% of serotonin is made in the digestive tract.
