The kidneys are the major excretory organs of the body, and are situated towards the back of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. They are responsible for maintaining the constancy of body fluids by filtering toxins, metabolic waste products and excess ions from the blood.  The end result of this process is the excretory fluid urine. There are over 1 million blood processing units within the kidneys called nephrons. They also excrete toxins ingested or produced by the body. The principle waste products in urine are urea (from protein metabolism), creatine (from muscle), uric acid (from metabolism of nucleic acids), bilirubin (from haemoglobin metabolism), and the broken down by-products of hormones. The nephron works by process of secretion followed by reabsorption. Nutrients and waste products flow freely out of the blood in the glomerulus into the Bowman’s capsule. These chemicals are accompanied by water and essential nutrients, which must be reclaimed by the body. This reabsorption occurs in the remaining parts of the nephron and renal tubules. The waste eventually drains into the collecting ducts to be eliminated from the body. Urine produced by the nephrons drains into the pelvis via calyces. In turn, the pelvis is linked to the ureter, the tubes that channel the urine to the bladder.

 Glucose is filtered across the glomerular capillaries and reabsorbed by the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. Glucose reabsorption is a two-step process involving sodium glucose cotransport across the luminal membrane and facilitated glucose transport across the peritubular membrane. Glucose moves from tubular fluid into the cell on the sodium+-glucose cotransporter in the luminal membrane. Glucose is transported from the cell into peritubular capillary blood by facilitated diffusion. Glucose moves down to its electrochemical gradient, and no energy is required. The proteins involved in facilitated diffusion of glucose are GLUT 1 and GLUT 2, which belong to a larger family of glucose carriers.

Both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentration can be used to estimate GFR (Glomerular filtration rate) because both urea and creatinine are filtered across the glomerular capillaries. Thus, each substance depends on the filtration step in order to be excreted in urine. When there is a decrease in GFR, BUN and serum creatinine increase because they are adequately filtered. In liver disease, blood ammonia will be high, and in kidney disease, blood urea will be high. The physical characteristics of the glomerular capillary wall determine both the rate of glomerular filtration and the characteristics of the glomerular filtrate. Glomerular filtration is the first step in the first step in the formation of urine. As the renal blood flow enters the glomerular capillaries, a portion of that blood is filtered into Bowman’s space, the first part of the nephron. The fluid that is filtered is similar to interstitial fluid and is called ultrafiltrate. The ultrafiltrate contains water and all the small solutes of blood, but it does not contain proteins and blood cells. Since pores in the endothelial cells relatively large, fluid, dissolved solutes, and plasma proteins are all filtered across this layer of glomerular capillary barrier. On the other hand, the pores are not so large that the blood cells can be filtered. The multilayered basement membrane does not permit filtration of plasma proteins and, therefore, constitutes the most significant barrier of the glomerular capillary. Plasma proteins have a net negative charge, and they will be restricted from filtration by their molecular size and the negative charges lining the glomerular barrier. In certain glomerular diseases, the negative charges on the barrier are removed, resulting in increased filtration of plasma proteins and proteinuria.

 The body uses its ions not only to help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, but also to regulate the acidity (pH) of its fluids. The body must maintain the pH within a narrow range (6.8-7.5), to avoid life-threatening consequences. Slight deviations in either direction can denature proteins, causing metabolic mayhem. Enzymes couldn’t catalyze reactions and hemoglobin couldn’t carry oxygen. The acidity of the body’s fluids is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). A high concentration of hydrogen ions is very acidic- (acidemia). Alkalemia, on the other hand, is a decrease in hydrogen concentration in blood or an increase in pH and is caused by a pathophysiologic process called alkalosis.  Normal energy metabolism generates hydrogen ions, as well as may other acids, that must be neutralized. Three systems defend the body against fluctuations in pH-buffers in the blood, respiration in the lungs, and excretion in the kidneys. The kidneys control concentration of bicarbonate by either reabsorbing or excreting it, depending on whether the pH needs to be increased, or decreased. The net effect is easy to sum up. The body’s total acid burden remains nearly constant; the acidity of the urine fluctuates to accommodate the balance.

<br>

White blood cells that protect the body against invasion by pathogens and foreign substances, remove debris from injured tissue, and aid in the healing process. Leukocytes are crucial to the body’s defense against disease. Unlike RBC’s that remain in the bloodstream, WBC’s migrate through endothelial walls of capillaries and venules, and enter tissue spaces by a process called diapedesis. Leukocytes are classified as either granulocytes or agranulocytes depending on whether their cytoplasm contains or lacks visible granules. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and are responsible for ingesting and destroying bacteria and other foreign particles. They are the most numerous circulating leukocyte. When leukocytes are found in the urine, this indicates infection, predominantly UTI’s and kidney infections, and kidney stones.

<br>
The human body is constantly exposed to sulfite generated from metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Neutrophils can also produce sulfite from sulfate in response to bacterial infections. Sulfite can be inhaled as sulfur dioxide, or ingested as food preservatives, particularly in wine and drug preparations. Chronic renal failure has been associated with oxidative stress due to excessive serum sulfites. These sulfates also damage kidney cells.
