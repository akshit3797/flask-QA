 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The falciform ligament separates the right and left lobes and attaches the liver to the anterior abdominal wall. The round ligament extends along the free edge of the falciform ligament, extending from the umbilicus to the inferior surface of the liver. The coronary ligament branches from the falciform ligament and extends over the superior surface of the right and left lobes, binding the liver to the inferior surface of the diaphragm.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The liver is covered by the Glisson capsule, which contain blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. When the liver is diseased or swollen, distention of the capsule causes pain and the lymphatics may ooze fluid into the peritoneal space. The metabolic functions of the liver require a large amount of blood. The liver receives blood from both arterial and venous sources. The hepatic artery branches from the abdominal aorta and provides oxygenated blood. The hepatic portal vein receives deoxygenated blood from the inferior and superior mesenteric and the splenic veins. Portal venous blood constitutes 70% of the blood supply to the liver.

<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This blood carries some oxygen and is rich in nutrients that have been absorbed from the digestive tract. In the liver lobes there are multiple, small anatomic units called liver lobules. They are formed of cords or plates of hypatocytes, which are the functional cells of the liver. These cells can regenerate. Small capillaries, or sinusoids, are located between the plates of hepatocytes. They receive a mixture of venous and arterial blood from branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein. 
<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood from the sinusoids drains to a central vein in the middle of each liver lobule. Venous blood from all the lobule then flows into the hepatic vein, which empties into the inferior vena cava and travels to the right atrium. The sinusoids of the liver lobules are lined with highly permeable endothelium. This permeability enhances the transport of nutrients from the sinusoids into the hepatocytes, where they are metabolized.

There are very tight interactions between the endocrine system and the liver. Hormones control many metabolic reactions and many processes of protein synthesis in the liver. The liver, on the other hand, is the major site for hormone metabolism. In the liver hormones may either be transformed into more active compounds (e.g., thyroxine into the four times as active t3) or be inactivated, catabolized and disposed of. Liver also influences hormone blood levels, being the site of transport protein synthesis. It is also the major source of hormone-dependent growth factors and of their inhibitors. These complex interactions between hormones and liver occur via receptors. Accordingly, specific membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear receptors for many hormones have been identified in liver tissue. The effectiveness of hormonal actions depends on the presence of specific receptors and is modulated by their concentration. The receptor binding capacity can be modified by the specific binding hormone and by other hormones as well. For example, estrogens may increase both estrogen and prolactin (PRL) receptors while testosterone decreases estrogen and PRL binding. Receptors for sexual hormones with properties similar to those in hormone-dependent sexual target tissues are present in the liver.  There are differences in male and female steroid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver; male livers have more oxidizing enzymes and female livers have more reducing enzymes, females have estrogen and PRL receptors; males, beside estrogen, have also androgen but not PRL receptors. Furthermore, male livers synthesize a male specific protein - a male estrogen binder (MEBP), which is not a receptor.


<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Metabolism in the Liver-</span>

The metabolic functions of the liver require a large amount of blood. The liver receives blood from both arterial and venous sources. The hepatic artery branches from the abdominal aorta and provides oxygenated blood at the rate of 400-500 ml/min. The hepatic portal vein, which receives deoxygenated blood from the infereior and superior mesenteric veins and the splic vein.  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a superfamily of mono-oxygenases that are found in all kingdoms of life, and which show extraordinary diversity in their reaction chemistry.  In mammals, these enzymes are found primarily in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes) within liver cells (hepatocytes), as well as many other cell types.  These enzymes use heme iron to oxidize molecules, often making them more water-soluble for clearance.  They achieve this by either adding or unmasking a polar group. Phase I biotransformation reactions introduce or expose functional groups with the goal of increasing the polarity of the compound. Although Phase I metabolism occurs in most tissues, the primary and first pass site of metabolism occurs during hepatic circulation. Additional metabolism occurs in gastrointestinal epithelial, renal, skin, and lung tissues. Within cells, most phase I enzymes are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and thus are enriched in microsomal preparations. Phase 2 Combination of a glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid or amino acid with a functional group to form a polar conjugate that can be readily excreted in urine or feces. The enzymes catalyzing these reactions are mostly located in the cytosol of the hepatocytes.

DPP4 production by the liver is the cause rather than the consequence of a fatty liver and insulin resistance. DPP4 is an enzyme that, to a large extent, is produced by the liver and inhibits the effects of important intestinal hormones that are involved in blood glucose metabolism. In addition, patients suffering from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have elevated DPP4 levels in their blood. To date, however, it was unclear whether elevated levels of DPP4 in fatty livers are the cause or consequence of the disease. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartame transaminase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl are the specific liver enzymes that almost commonly found in fatty liver disease, which indicates inflammation and injury of the liver cells.

<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Glycolosis-</span>

If oxygen is not available to the electron-transport chain, ATP will not be formed by the mitochondria. Instead, an anaerobic metabolic pathway synthesizes ATP. This process, called substrate phosphorylation or anaerobic glycolysis, is linked to the breakdown of carbohydrates. Because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, it provides energy for cells that lack mitochondria. The reactions in glycolysis involve the conversion of glucose to pyruvate acid with the simultaneous production of ATP. With the glycolysis of one molecule of glucose, two ATP molecules and to molecules of pyruvate are liberated. If oxygen is present, the two molecules of pyruvate move into the mitochondria where the enter the citric acid cycle. If oxygen is absent, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid which is released into the extracellular fluid. The conversion to pyruvate acid to lactic acid is reversible; therefore, once oxygen is restored, lactic acid is quickly converted back to pyruvic acid or glucose. The anaerobic generation of ATP from glucose through glycolysis not as efficient as the aerobic generation process. Adding an oxygen requiring stage to the catabolic process provides cells with a much more powerful method for extracting energy from food molecules. 

<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gluconeogenesis:</span>

The precursors of gluconeogenesis are lactate, glycerol, amino acids, and with propionate making a minor contribution. The gluconeogenesis pathway consumes ATP, which is derived primarily from the oxidation of fatty acids. The pathway uses several enzymes of the glycolysis. The irreversible reactions of glycolysis are bypassed by four alternate unique reactions of gluconeogenesis.  Pyruvate carboxylase, located in the mitochondrial matrix, phosphoenolpyruate (PEP) carboxykinase located in mitochondrial matrix and cytosol, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase located in the cytosol and glucose-6-phosphatase located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glucagon increases gluconeogenesis by decreasing the production of fructose 2,6 biphosphate, which decreases phosphofructokinase activity. Thus, substrate is directed toward the formation of glucose. Amino acids are utilized for gluconeogenesis, and the resulting amino groups are incorporated into the urea. 

<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ATP (CoQ10/ALA):</span>

Glycolysis produces two molecules of ATP per glucose molecule through oxidation, or the removal and transfer of a pair of electrons, with the process of oxidative cellular metabolism. For a cell to function, it must be able to extract and use the chemical energy in organic molecules. When 1 mole of glucose metabolically breaks down in the presence into carbon dioxide and water, chemical energy is released. The cell uses ATP for active transport of molecules across cellular membranes. ATP begins with the citric acid cycle and ends with oxidative phosphorylation.

<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Krebs Cycle</span>:

Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria and loses carbon dioxide to form acetyl-CoA, a 2-carbon molecule. When acetyl-CoA is oxidized to carbon dioxide in the Krebs cycle, chemical energy is released and captured in the form of NADH, FADH<sub>2</sub>, and ATP. The electron transport chain allows the release of the large amount of chemical energy stored in reduced NAD<sup>+</sup>(NADH) and reduced FAD (FADH<sub>2</sub>). The energy released is captured in the form of ATP. Fermentation complements glycolysis and makes it possible for ATP to be continually produced in the absence of oxygen. By oxidizing the NADH produced in glycolysis, fermentation regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup>, which can take part in glycolysis once again to produce more ATP.
