Glucose (blood sugar) is filtered across glomerular capillaries and reabsorbed by the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. Glucose reabsorption involving Sodium glucose cotransport across the luminal membrane and facilitated glucose transport. Glucose moves from tubular fluid into the cell. The sodium gradient is maintained by K+. Glucose is transported from the cell into peritubular capillary blood by facilitated diffusion.

<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hyperglycemia- </span></b>Type 1 diabetes Mellitus, is caused by destruction of Beta cells, often as a result of an autoimmune process. When pancreatic beta cells do not secrete adequate amounts, carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism will all be disturbed.  Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the following changes: Increased blood glucose concentration from decreased uptake of glucose into the cells, decreased glucose utilization, and increased gluconeogenesis. The increased blood glucose concentration results in an increased filtered load of glucose. Lack of insulin also causes a shift of potassium out of the cells (recall that insulin promotes potassium uptake), resulting in hyperkalemia.

Type 2 diabetes (Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is often associated with obesity. Type 2 diabetes is caused by down-regulation of insulin recept9ors in target tissues and insulin resistance. Insulin is secreted normally by the beta cells, but at normal concentrations, it cannot activate its receptors on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue; thus, insulin is unable to produce its usual metabolic effects. Typically, the blood glucose concentration is elevated in both fasting and after eating. An abnormal A1c would be anything above 6.5 or is sometimes determined as a fasting blood sugar reading above 115. Blood sugars should be checked before meals, and 2 hours after meals when blood sugar is at its highest point.
