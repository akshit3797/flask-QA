1. Gymnema Sylvestre- Blocks receptors in your intestines and thus sugar absorption, lowering your post-meal blood sugar levels. Also stimulates insulin production and promotes the regeneration of insulin-producing islet cells. Decreases sugar cravings.
<br>
*   500mg 30 minutes before each meal
<br><br>
2. Chromium picolinate- A necessary cofactor for optimal insulin action. It also aids in the breakdown process of carbohydrates and fats. The mechanism involves increased insulin binding, increased insulin receptor number and increased insulin phosphorylation. Stimulates protein kinase activity of adipocytes in the presence of insulin-increasing insulin sensitivity. 
<br>
*   200 mcg 1x morning
<br><br>
3. Vanadium- A trace mineral, mimics insulin and prevents increases in blood sugar levels after carbohydrate consumption. Taken with Co-Q10, increases the formation of enzymes that help cells turn glucose into energy. 
<br>
*   2 mg 1x  morning
<br><br>
4. Amla- Comprises chromium, a mineral that regulates carbohydrate metabolism and makes the pancreas more responsive to insulin, further keeping the blood sugar levels in control. 
<br>
*   1g 1x daily
<br><br>
5. Fenugreek- High in soluble fibre, which helps lower blood sugar by slowing down digestion and absorption of carbohydrates.
<br>
*   2.5g 2x daily
<br><br>
6. Alpha lipoic acid- Increases insulin sensitivity and helps reduce blood sugar and lipids, largely through improving measures of oxidative stress and inflammation.
<br>
*   600mg 2x daily
<br><br>
7. Inositol- Functions as a secondary messenger that help with insulin signaling and help the cell take in glucose from the blood.
<br>
*   2g 2x daily
<br><br>
8. Gynostemma- Improves cells insulin sensitivity.
<br>
*   6g 2x daily with 2 meals of the day
<br><br>
9. L-Carnitine- Reduces the health risks posed by poor fat metabolism associated with diabetes and prevents fatty buildup around the heart and liver. Its main function in the body is to help transport long-chain fatty acids, which are burned within the cells to provide energy. 
<br>
*   500mg 1x daily
<br><br>
10. Bitter Melon- Increases the availability of glucose to muscles. Keeps sugars from being absorbed through the intestine.
Ten: Bupleurum- Reduces the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream after meals and increases the efficiency of insulin. Bupleurum is specifically useful if diabetes occurs with long-term gastrointestinal disorders.

*   2,000mg daily
