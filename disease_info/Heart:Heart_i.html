**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Heart- </span>**Each side of the heart has 2 chambers. An atrium and a ventricle, connected by one-way valves, called atrioventricular valves (AV). The AV are designed to that blood can flow only in one direction, from the atrium to the ventricle. The left and right heart have different functions. The left heart and the systemic arteries, capillaries, and veins are collectively called the systemic circulation. The left ventricle pumps blood to all organs of the body except the lungs. The right heart and the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins are collectively called the pulmonary circulation. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs. The left heart and right heart function in series so that blood is pumped sequentially from the left heart to the systemic circulation, to the right heart, to the pulmonary circulation, and then back to the left heart. 


            **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cardiac Output</span>**:


            The rate at which blood is pumped from either ventricle. Because the 2 sides of the heart operate in series, the cardiac output of the left ventricle equals the cardiac output of the right ventricle in the steady state. The rate at which blood is returned to the atria from the veins is called the venous return. Oxygenated blood fills the left ventricle. Blood is ejected from the left ventricle in the aorta. Blood leaves the left ventricle through the aortic valve. Cardiac output is distributed among various organs. Blood flow from the organs is collected in the veins. Venous return to the right atrium. The vena cava carries blood to the right heart. Mixed venous blood fills the right ventricle. Blood is ejected from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Blood flow from the lungs is returned to the heart via and pulmonary vein. 


            **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blood Pressure/Pulse:</span>**


            Blood flow through a blood vessel or a series of blood vessels is determined by 2 factors; The pressure difference between the ends of the vessel (The inlet and the outlet) and the resistance of the vessel to the blood flow. The pressure difference is the driving force for blood flow, and the resistance is an impediment to flow. The relationship of flow, pressure, and resistance is analogous to the relationship of current, voltage, and resistance in electrical circuits as expressed in Ohm’s law. Blood flow is analogous to current flow, the pressure difference or driving force is analogous to the voltage difference, and hydrodynamic resistance is analogous to electrical resistance. Pulse is change in pressure.


            The magnitude of blood flow is directly proportional to the size of the pressure difference or pressure gradient. The direction of blood flow is determined by the direction of the pressure gradient and always is from high to low pressure. During ventricular ejection, blood flows from the left ventricle into the aorta and not in the other direction because pressure in the ventricle is higher than pressure in the aorta. 


            **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diastolic Pressure</span>**- Is the lowest arterial pressure measured during a cardiac cycle and is the pressure of the artery during ventricular relaxation when no blood is being ejected from the left ventricle. 


             **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Systolic Pressure</span>**- Is the highest arterial pressure measured during a cardiac cycle. It is the pressure of the artery after blood has been ejected from the left ventricle during systole. The blip of the arterial pressure curve, called the dicrotic notch is produced when the aortic valve closes. The aortic valve closure produces a brief period of retro grade flow from the aorta back toward the valve, briefly decreasing aortic pressure below the systolic value. 


            **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pulse Pressure</span>**- Is the difference between the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. If all other factors are equal, the magnitude of the pulse pressure reflects the volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle on a single beat, or the stroke volume. Pulse pressure can be used as an indicator of stroke volume because of the relationships between pressure, volume, and compliance. Compliance of a blood vessel is the volume the vessel can hold at a given pressure. 


            **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stress and Anxiety</span>**:


            Excessive stress may contribute in the development of high blood pressure by causing the medulla to malfunction. Nervous control blood pressure sensors in the arteries send information, via nerves, to the medulla, which calculates whether blood pressure needs to be corrected. If so, the medulla in turn sends nerve signals to the heart, to modify its rate and strength of beating, and to the blood vessels to modify their diameter. The pressure of blood in the arteries is constantly measured by specialized pressure sensors called baroreceptors. Baroreceptors are verve endings contained within the walls of an artery which are able to detect even the smallest distension of the arterial wall. These pressure sensors are mainly found in the aortic arch and the carotid sinuses. The baroreceptor endings are part of nerve fibres which travel to the medulla. The afferent fibres of the aortic baroreceptors from the aortic nerve joins the vagus nerve before entering the medulla, where they terminate in a region called the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). The afferent fibres of the carotid baroreceptors from the carotid sinus nerve, joins the glossopharyngeal nerve before also terminating the NTS. During periods of intense stress, the baroreceptor reflux is strongly suppressed by nerves originating from the hypothalamus. This process contributes to high blood pressure. IF pressure is maintained at a raised level for many minutes, the baroreceptors become accustomed to the new pressure and “think” that it is the correct level. Thus, baroreceptors cannot accurately inform the brain about blood pressure levels over long-term. The neurons within the NTS are strongly suppressed, allowing blood pressure to rise.
