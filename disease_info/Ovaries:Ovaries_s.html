1. Chastberry Vitex- Stimulates and normalizes pituitary gland function. It normalizes the activity of female sex hormones, and is indicated for dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, menopausal symptoms, nostalgia, and other disorders related to hormone imbalance. Vitex does not contain plant estrogens. Instead it contains atleast 2 forms of testosterone as well as the growth stimulant hormones androstenedione and progesterone.  Vitex also lowers prolactin. 
*   500mg 2x daily
2.  Dong quai- Regulator of female reproductive system. Some of its compounds stimulate the uterus, while others relax the uterus. The compounds that stimulate the uterus are water soluble and are absorbed into the body from teas or capsules containing freeze dried herb. The compounds that relax the uterus have a very high boiling point, and are soluble in alcohol, and are provided by tinctures. 
*   1,000 mg 2x daily
3. Black cohosh- Balances hormones levels in both men and women. May increase the blood flow to the uterus, reducing the intensity of painful menstrual cramps. One of the chemical constituents of black cohosh, ferulic acid, increases the motility and viability of sperm cells by protecting their cell walls from oxidation. It also offsets a decline in estrogen by providing phytoestrogens that mimic the hormone’s effects. These phytoestrogens bind to hormone receptors in the uterus and breast.
*   500mg 1x daily
4. Wild yam- Diosgenin, a saponin found in wild yam, was shown to have estrogenic and progestogenic effects in mice. Diosgenin can be converted by the human body into progesterone and other steroid hormones via DHEA. 
*   900mg 1x daily
5. Shatavari- This herb balances the production of adrenal cortisol, making it a natural adaptogen.  Shatavari contains steroid saponins such as sarsaponin, protodioscin, and diosgenin, which are the most likely estrogenic components extracted from asparagus roots. These compounds also act as a precursor of progesterone and increase secretion of this hormone.
*   
6.  Damiana- Relaxes the arteries in the uterus, leading to more blood flow. Damiana is one of the most powerful aphrodisiac herbs known. An extract of damiana showed anti-aromatase activity, especially by the damiana components, pinocembrin and acacetin. (Acacetin is structurally related to chrysin, which is an aromatase inhibitor.) An extract showed weak estrogenic activity, especially by components apigenin 7-glucoside, Z-echinacin and pinocembrin.
7. Chrysin- A flavone class of flavonoids. An aromatase inhibitor. Phytoestrogenic and anxiolytic. Chrysin has been shown to be among the most potent of the natural and synthetic flavone inhibitors of human estrogen aromatase. 
8. DIM- Prevents the conversion of testosterone into estrogen. DIM has no estrogenic activity in itself. Although it helps to convert estrogen to useful metabolites, it does not directly mimic or replace estrogen. Using DIM will promote a more desirable estrogen metabolism, but it will not make up for estrogen deficiency. 
9. Maca-  Can be successfully used as a hormone balancer, reducing or eliminating hot flashes, vaginal dryness, depression due to low estrogen, supporting a healthy libido, without any of the dangerous side effects of estrogen supplementation (HRT). The Maca-DIM combination is particularly helpful for both reducing the risk of developing an estrogen-dependent cancer as well as with relieving hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, this combination supports the health of the adrenal glands, thyroid, pancreas and neurotransmitter hormone production, including melatonin.
10. Royal Jelly- Promotes folliculogensis and increases ovarian hormones. Induces ovarian blood flow and helping follicular rupture, which makes this substance one of the most powerful remedies to increase ovulation and fertility.
