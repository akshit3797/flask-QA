Low glycemic index (GI) foods. The glycemic index is a relative ranking of carbohydrate foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels. Carbohydrates with a low GI value (55 or less) are more slowly digested, absorbed and metabolized. They cause a slower, and more gradual rise in blood glucose, rather than a sudden spike- as simple carbohydrates. Therefore, stabilizing blood sugar levels throughout the course of the day.
