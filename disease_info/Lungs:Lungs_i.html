The pulmonary system consists of the lungs, airways, chest wall, and pulmonary circulation. Its primary function is the exchange of gases between the environmental air and blood. The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is carried to all the cells of the body in exchange for CO2, a waste product. The lungs and airways transport oxygen-enriched air from the atmosphere to the lungs and carry CO2 from the lungs to the atmosphere by a process called breathing, also known as ventilation. Breathing (pulmonary ventilation) helps regulate pH of the blood, maintaining homeostatis. 


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shortness of breath (SOB)-</span></b> Dyspnea is the subjective sensation of uncomfortable breathing, the feeling of being unable to get enough air. It is often described as breathlessness. One proposed mechanism for dyspnea is a mismatch between sensory and motor input from the respiratory center such that there is more urge to breathe than there is response by the respiratory muscles. Other causes of dyspnea include stimulation of central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and stimulation of afferent receptors in the lung and chest wall. Pulmonary congestion tends to cause dyspnea when the individual is lying down. 


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exertion</span></b>: <br> During expiration, muscle relaxation causes the lungs to contract. This increases the pressure in the alveolar to a point where it is greater than pressure at the airway opening. Air now flows out of the lungs.


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Skin</span></b>-<br> Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes caused by increasing amounts of desaturated or deduced hemoglobin in the blood. It generally develops when 5 g of hemoglobin is desaturated, regardless of hemoglobin concentration. This can be caused by decreased arterial oxygenation, pulmonary or cardiac output, cold environment, or anxiety. Severe anemia and carbon monoxide poisoning can also cause inadequate oxygenation of tissues without causing cyanosis. Central cyanosis is best seen in buccal mucous membranes and lips. Peripheral cyanosis is often seen in nail beds. 


A condition known as sarcoidosis, causes clusters of immune cells called granulomas to infiltrate your organs and lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis most commonly affects your lungs and is apparent as lesions on various places of the sin. Sarcoidosis can lead to scar tissue in your lungs while also making them function more poorly.  


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chest-</span></b> If the chest wall is deformed, traumatized, immobilized, or made heavy by fat, the work of breathing increases ventilation may be compromised because of a decrease in tidal volume. The degree of ventilatory impairment depends on the severity of the chest wall abnormality. Flail chest results from the fracture of several consecutive ribs in more than one place or the fracture of the sternum plus several consecutive ribs. Impairment of respiratory muscle function caused by neuromuscular disease also can restrict chest wall and impair pulmonary function. Muscle weakness can result in hypoventilation, inability  to remove secretions, and hypoxemia. Chest wall restrictions results in a decrease in tidal volume. An increase in respiratory rate can compensate for small decreases in tidal volume, but many patients will progress to hypercapnic respiratory failure. 


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">IgA-</span></b>  The predominant immunoglobulin class in lung secretions in contrast to blood plasma, where IgG is found at higher concentrations. Most of the IgA in the blood (about 90%) is monomer (mIgA), whereas in lung secretions about half the IgA is dimeric and most of this is in the form of secretory IgA. 3 Two subclasses of IgA, IgAl and IgA2, have been distinguished in serum and secretions by the use of specific antibodies. In the blood IgA2 comprises 10-20% of the total IgA but in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples it represents about 30%. These differences in the IgA composition of serum and lung secretions reflect the considerable local synthesis of IgA within the lung, although a proportion of the IgA in lung secretions is still derived from the blood by transudation. 


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">IgE</span>-</b><br> Present at low concentrations in serum and broncoalveolar lavage fluid from the bronchial mucosa. IgE is bound by Fc receptors on mast cells. Cross bridging of the cell bound IgE with specific antigen results in the release of several active substances from the mast cell, including histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4), which result in bronchiolar smooth muscle contraction and increased blood vessel permeability.


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">IgM</span>-</b><br> The most effective complement fixing immunoglobulin class and the 10 antigen binding sites on the pentameric structure ensure that it is a good agglutinating antibody. IgM is the first immunoglobulin to be detected in the blood during the primary and secondary antibody responses and its main role is generally considered to be the neutralization of pathogens, especially viruses, in the vascular compartment. The role of IgM in the lung secretions is less well understood, although its ability to activate complement and opsonise pathogens is likely to be of major importance.


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NO-</span></b> There is a relationship between hypoxic vasoconstriction and nitric oxide synthesis in the endothelial cells of the pulmonary  vasculature. Nitric oxide is an endothelial-derived relaxing factor that is synthesized from L-arginine by the action of nitric oxide synthase. NO then activates guanylyl cyclase, leading to production of cyclic guanosine, monophosphate (cGMP) and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enhances hypoxic vasoconstriction, and inhaled NO reduces, or offsets, hypoxic vasoconstriction. 


<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Enzymes</span>-</b><br> Angiotensin converting enzyme is found on the surface of capillary endothelial cells in the lungs. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Emphysema is commonly linked to an inherited deficiency of the enzyme alpha1-antitrypsin, a major component of a plasma protein. Alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits the action of many proteolytic enzymes, there the deficiency produces an increased likelihood of developing emphysema because proteolysis in lung tissues is not inhibited. It is suggested in individuals who develop emphysema before age 40 and in non-smokers who develop the disease.
