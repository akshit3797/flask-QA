<u><b>SLC6A3 gene</u> : </b>
<br>The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT.  Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement
 <br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 5p15.33, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 5 at position 15.33
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 1,392,790 to 1,445,428 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 
<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT. This protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement.
To transmit signals, dopamine is released into the space between neurons (the synaptic cleft), where it attaches (binds) to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. The dopamine transporter brings dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into neurons for reuse. The activity of the transporter determines how much dopamine is present in the synaptic cleft and for how long. This activity makes the transporter a major controller of dopamine signaling in the brain.

<u><b>DDC gene</u> : </b>
<br>dopa decarboxylase
This enzyme takes part in the pathway that produces dopamine and serotonin, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells (neurotransmitters).
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 7p12.2-p12.1, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 between positions 12.2 and 12.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 50,458,436 to 50,565,460 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The DDC gene provides instructions for making the aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme, which is important in the brain and nervous system. This enzyme takes part in the pathway that produces dopamine and serotonin, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells (neurotransmitters).
Dopamine is produced from the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine, and serotonin is produced from the amino acid tryptophan. Both neurotransmitters are produced in two-step processes. First, other enzymes control the reactions that convert tyrosine to L-dopa, and tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan. The AADC enzyme then converts L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan to dopamine and serotonin, respectively. To do this, it removes a molecular structure called a carboxyl group, consisting of a carbon atom, two oxygen atoms, and a hydrogen atom.

<u><b>TH gene</u> : </b>
<br>tyrosine hydroxylase  The TH gene provides instructions for making the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is important for normal functioning of the nervous system. This enzyme helps convert the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine to a catecholamine called dopamine. transmits signals between nerve cells in the brain to help control physical movement and emotional behavior. 
<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The TH gene provides instructions for making the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is important for normal functioning of the nervous system. Tyrosine hydroxylase takes part in the first step of the pathway that produces a group of hormones called catecholamines. This enzyme helps convert the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine to a catecholamine called dopamine. Dopamine is also known as a neurotransmitter because it transmits signals between nerve cells in the brain to help control physical movement and emotional behavior. Other catecholamines called norepinephrine and epinephrine are produced from dopamine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are involved in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature.

<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 77,460,848 to 77,464,022 on chromosome 6 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)


<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

From NCBI Gene:
The protein encoded by this intronless gene is a G-protein coupled receptor for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Ligand binding activates second messengers that inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase and manage the release of serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine in the brain. The encoded protein may be involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders and therefore is often a target of antidepressant and other psychotherapeutic drugs. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]
From UniProt:
G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Also functions as a receptor for ergot alkaloid derivatives, various anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs and other psychoactive substances, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase activity. Arrestin family members inhibit signaling via G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling pathways. Regulates the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity, nociceptive processing, pain perception, mood and behavior. Besides, plays a role in vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries.

This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors. The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain, which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<u><b>TOR1A gene</u> : </b>
<br>torsin family 1 member A
 High levels of torsinA in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This region contains nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements.
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 9q34.11, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 34.11
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 129,812,942 to 129,824,162 on chromosome 9 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The TOR1A gene (also known as DYT1) provides instructions for making a protein called torsinA. This protein is found in the space between two neighboring structures within cells, the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum. The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum processes proteins and other molecules and helps transport them to specific destinations either inside or outside the cell. Although little is known about the function of torsinA, studies suggest that it may help process and transport other proteins. TorsinA may also participate in the movement of membranes associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum.
TorsinA is active in many of the body's tissues, and it is particularly important for the normal function of nerve cells in the brain. For example, researchers have found high levels of torsinA in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This region contains nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements.

<u><b>RGS9 gene</u> : </b>
<br>regulator of G protein signaling 9
, RGS9-2 appears to be part of signaling pathways involving a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. These pathways are important for planning and coordinating movement. <br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 17q24.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 24.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 65,137,338 to 65,227,703 on chromosome 17 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The RGS9 gene provides instructions for making two versions (isoforms) of the RGS9 protein, known as RGS9-1 and RGS9-2. They are found in different parts of the nervous system and have very different functions.
RGS9-1 is produced in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, RGS9-1 is associated with light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in these cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. (This process is known as phototransduction.) Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. RGS9-1 is involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.
RGS9-2 is found primarily in an area deep within the brain called the striatum. Although its exact role is unknown, RGS9-2 appears to be part of signaling pathways involving a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. These pathways are important for planning and coordinating movement. Studies suggest that RGS9-2 also plays a role in the brain's response to opioid drugs, such as morphine and cocaine.

<u><b>DPYS gene</u> : </b>
<br>dihydropyrimidinase
Beta-alanine is thought to be involved in sending signals between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) and in controlling the level of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. 
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 8q22.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 8 at position 22.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 104,379,424 to 104,467,074 on chromosome 8 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)


<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The DPYS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidinase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of molecules called pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA. The dihydropyrimidinase enzyme is involved in the second step of the three-step process that breaks down pyrimidines. This step opens the ring-like structures of molecules called 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil. Further breakdown of these molecules leads to the production of other molecules called beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine, which are thought to play roles in the nervous system. Beta-aminoisobutyric acid increases the production and release (secretion) of a protein called leptin, which has been found to help protect brain cells from damage caused by toxins, inflammation, and other factors. Beta-alanine is thought to be involved in sending signals between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) and in controlling the level of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine.
The dihydropyrimidinase enzyme also helps break down certain drugs called fluoropyrimidines that are used to treat cancer. Common examples of these drugs are 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine.

<u><b>COMT gene</u> : </b>
<br>catechol-O-methyltransferase
neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Catechol-O-methyltransferase helps maintain appropriate levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. 
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location:<br> 22q11.21, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.21
<br><br>Molecular Location : <br> base pairs 19,941,740 to 19,969,975 on chromosome 22 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The COMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase. Two versions of this enzyme are made from the gene. The longer form, called membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT), is chiefly produced by nerve cells in the brain. Other tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and blood, produce a shorter form of the enzyme called soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT). This form of the enzyme helps control the levels of certain hormones.
In the brain, catechol-O-methyltransferase helps break down certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These chemicals conduct signals from one nerve cell to another. Catechol-O-methyltransferase is particularly important in an area at the front of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which organizes and coordinates information from other parts of the brain. This region is involved with personality,  memory. To function efficiently, the prefrontal cortex requires signaling by neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Catechol-O-methyltransferase helps maintain appropriate levels of these neurotransmitters in this part of the brain.
