Adrenal hyperfunction (Cushing syndrome) causes adrenal tissue to secrete excess cortisol and is manifested by a constellation of symptoms. Accordingly, ACTH levels are low because the high cortisol levels feed back on the anterior pituitary and inhibit ACTH secretion, so proper adrenal functioning is hindered.
