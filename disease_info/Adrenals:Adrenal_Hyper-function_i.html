Adrenal hyperfunction (Cushing syndrome) causes adrenal tissue to secrete excess cortisol and is manifested by a constellation of symptoms. Accordingly, ACTH levels are low because the high cortisol levels feed back on the anterior pituitary and inhibit ACTH secretion, so proper adrenal functioning is hindered. 


Symptoms depend on which hormones are being over produced:
