<li>
Magnesium- Has parallel effects on PTH secretion and like hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia stimulates PTH secretion, and hypermagnesemia inhibits PTH secretion. </li>
<br>

<li>Vitamin D- The second major regulatory hormone for calcium and phosphate metabolism. The role of PTH is to maintain the plasma calcium concentration, and itâ€™s actions are coordinated to increase the ionized calcium concentration toward normal levels.</li>
<br>

<li>Calcium aspartate- Decreases serum PTH levels. Necessary in serum hypocalcemia.</li>
<br>

<li>Spleen tissue- regulates the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues.</li>
<br>

<li>Parathyroid tissue- Increases Serum calcium.</li>
