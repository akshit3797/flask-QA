1. Magnesium- Has parallel effects on PTH secretion and like hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia stimulates PTH secretion, and hypermagnesemia inhibits PTH secretion. 
2. Vitamin D- The second major regulatory hormone for calcium and phosphate metabolism. The role of PTH is to maintain the plasma calcium concentration, and itâ€™s actions are coordinated to increase the ionized calcium concentration toward normal levels.
3. Calcium aspartate- Decreases serum PTH levels. Necessary in serum hypocalcemia.
4. Spleen tissue- regulates the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues.
5. Parathyroid tissue- Increases Serum calcium.
