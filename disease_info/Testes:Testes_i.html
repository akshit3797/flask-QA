The Testes, also known as the male gonads, consist of 3 cell types; germ cells, which produce spermatogonia, the sertoli cells, which synthesize glycoprotein hormone (antimullerian hormone), lyedig cells which synthesize testosterone.

Testosterone is the active androgenic hormone. In other target tissues, testosterone must be activated to dihydrotestosterone by the action of 5- alpha reductase. It is responsible for the fetal differentiation of the internal male genital tract; the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. The mechanism of action of androgens begins with binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to an androgen receptor protein in cells of target tissues. The androgen receptor complex moves into the nucleus, where it initiates gene transcription.
