The female gonads are the ovaries, which, together with the uterus and the fallopian tubes, constitute the female reproductive track. The ovaries, analogous to the testes in the male, have 2 functions; oogenesis and secretion of the female sex steroid hormones, progesterone and estrogen. Each adult ovary is attached to the uterus by ligaments, and running through these ligaments are the ovarian arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. The ovary has 3 zones. The cortex is the outer and largest zone. The medulla is the middle zone and is a mixture of cell types. The hilum is the inner zone, through which blood vessels and lymphatics pass. Optimal estrogen metabolism in women is defined by the ample production of “good” estrogen metabolites. 
<br>These metabolites help lower the risk of cancer and decrease the symptoms of estrogen over-stimulation, or dominance-symptoms of which include breast tenderness, rapidly growing uterine fibroid tumors, uterine cervix problems (as seen with abnormal PAP smears) and endometriosis, a painful condition caused by persistent uterine tissue growing in abnormal locations within the abdomen.
