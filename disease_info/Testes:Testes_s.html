1. Tribulus- The main active compound known as protodioscin, increased the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). LH is known to regulate fertility and, upon reaching the testicles, helps stimulate the release of testosterone.  Tribulus also has inhibitory effects on the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, which reduces the breakdown of testosterone. So, theoretically it could increase testosterone by preserving it rather than creating more of it.

2. DHEA- A steroid hormone that acts as a precursor for testosterone. DHEA is known to have androgenic affects on both male and females. DHEA is distributed to various tissues in the body where metabolites, including androstenedione, testosterone, and estrogens are metabolized.

3.  Cistanche-  Stimulates the CYP-enzyme family which results in improved testicular testosterone production. Reverses damage to testicular leydig cells and suppression of testosterone levels.

4. D-Aspartic acid- Works in the hypothalamus and pituitary to cause a release of hormones, such as luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone. It may also build up in the testicles, where it alleviates a rate-limiting step of testosterone synthesis.

5. ZMA (zinc,magnesium,aspartate)- Zinc is involved with sperm formation and testosterone metabolism. If deficient in this mineral, T levels cannot properly rise. This combination is also known to boost Growth hormone. IGF-1.

6. Muira Puama- The root and bark of muira puama are rich in fatty acids, fatty acid esters, essential oils, plant sterols, and triterpenes. Muira Puama contains “sterols”, the building blocks of sex hormones such as testosterone. This herb relaxes the corpus cavernosa, a sponge like area that holds blood during an erection. This relaxation allows more blood to flow to the penis, producing a stronger and firmer erectile response.

7. Catuaba- Stimulates blood flow to the genitals, can strengthen and prolong an erection, enhances sexual excitement and is said to give more powerful orgasms.  Contains specific alkaloids believed to support libido, including _“yohimbe” _which seems to be the most active compound that produces a stimulatory effect on the libido of both men and women. These alkaloids are thought to enhance sexual function by stimulating the nervous system.

8. Yohimbe- An alpha-blocker that dilates blood vessels. yohimbe has shown to make erections firmer. It is thought to help sustain an erection by causing compression and preventing blood to flow back out of the penis while sexually aroused.

9. Tongkat Ali- Stimulates the release of free testosterone, improves sex drive, reduces fatigue, and improves wellbeing.
