The stomach is a hollow, muscular organ just below the diaphragm that stores food during eating, secretes digestive juices, mixes food with these juices, ad propels partially digested food, called chyme, into the duodenum of the small intestine. Its major anatomic boundaries are the lower esophageal sphincter, where food passes through the cardiac orfice into the stomach.

<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cardiac atrium</span></b><br>- The cardiac region is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach and through which food passes into the stomach. 

<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fundus-</span></b><br> While the food is in the fundus, the digestive activities of salivary amylase continue until the food begins mixing with the acidic chyme. Mixing waves incorporate this food with chyme, the acidity of which inactivates salivary amylase and activates lingual lipase which begins breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides. The composition of gastric juices depends on volume and rate. Potassium remains relatively constant, but its concentration is greater in gastric juice than plasma. 

<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pyloric atrium-</span></b><br> The initial portion of the pylorus, which holds around 30mL of chyme, acts as a filter, permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly, but not fully, closed pyloric sphincter. Gastric emptying, rhythmic mixing waves force the chyme through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum.  Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle. The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force chyme into the duodenum. 

Low hydrochloric acid can be the source of constipation, bloating, and acid reflux. Gastrin is released by cells in the stomach is response to distention of the stomach. The gastrin increases muscle movement in the stomach and enhances the release of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen to encourage digestion. Secretin is released by cells along the duodenal wall when acidic chyme begins to move into the duodenum. Secretin opposes the action of gastrin and reduces gastric secretion, motility, and stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate in order to neutralize chyme.  CCK is then released along the small intestine. Insufficiency of Hydrochloric acid is usually prompted by inadequate dietary components and the inability for the mechanisms hinders gastric secretions. In turn, when there is lack of acid, heartburn, constipation, and delayed digestion are the common symptoms associated with low Hcl.
