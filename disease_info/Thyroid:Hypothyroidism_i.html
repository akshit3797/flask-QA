The function of the thyroid gland is to take iodine, found in many foods, and convert it into thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). **Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body which can absorb iodine. These cells combine iodine and the amino acid <b>tyrosine</b> to make T3 and T4. T3 and T4 are then released into the blood stream and are transported throughout the body where they control metabolism (conversion of oxygen and calories to energy). Stimulates gluconeogenesis; inhibits inflammatory response; suppresses immune response; Enhances vascular responsiveness to catecholamines.

Deficient production of Thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism. It generally affects all body systems and occurs insidiously over months or years. The decrease in TH lowers energy metabolism and heat production. Low basal metabolic rate, cold intolerance, lethargy, tiredness, and slightly lowered body temperature.  There are 2 main thyroid hormones; Thyroxine (T4) our inactive thyroid hormone, and triiodothyronine (T3) our active thyroid hormone. T3 possesses four times the activity of T4. T4 must be converted into T3 inside the cell before it can be used. Our body MUST make this conversion for the thyroid to work efficiently.

The decrease in thyroid hormone can lead to excessive TSH production and goiter. In primary hypothyroidism, loss of thyroid tissue leads to decreased production of TH, increased secretion of TSH, and goiter. Secondary hypothyroidism is usually caused by the pituitary’s failure to synthesize adequate amounts of TSH. Pituitary tumors or the results of the treatment are the most common causes of secondary hypothyroidism. Other causes of hypothyroidism are surgical removal of the thyroid as treatment for hyperthyroidism, hypothalamic or pituitary failure, and iodine deficiency.
