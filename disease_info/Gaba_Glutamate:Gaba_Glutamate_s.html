1. Valerian root- Increases the sensitivity ofand binds to the GABA receptor site, increasing the sensitivity of GABA in the brain.  Valerian root, or valeric acid, also slows the breakdown of GABA. 
<br><br>
2. Lithium orotate- A naturally occurring mineral that is essential to the body. Lithium works by increasing GABA receptor site sensitivity. 
<br><br>
3. Passion flower- Works similarly to Lithium orotate and valerian root, by increasing the sensitivity of GABA receptor sites. Also helpful for anxiety, insomnia, and hysteria by GABA deficiency. 
<br><br>
4. L-theanine- An amino acid that mimics GABA and crosses the blood-brain barrier. L-theanine actively increases GABA. 
<br><br>
5. Taurine- Has a molecular structure similar to GABA and impacts GABA activity. 
<br><br>
6. P-5-P- Necessary co-factors for the synthesis and breakdown of GABA. 
<br><br>
7. Magnesium- Co-factor for GABA
<br><br>
8. Zinc- Co-factor for GABA, especially in conjunction with p-5-p. 
<br><br>
9. Manganese- Supports and maintains GABA levels.
