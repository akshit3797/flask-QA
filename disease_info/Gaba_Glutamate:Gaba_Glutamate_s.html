1. Valerian root- Increases the sensitivity ofand binds to the GABA receptor site, increasing the sensitivity of GABA in the brain.  Valerian root, or valeric acid, also slows the breakdown of GABA. 
2. Lithium orotate- A naturally occurring mineral that is essential to the body. Lithium works by increasing GABA receptor site sensitivity. 
3. Passion flower- Works similarly to Lithium orotate and valerian root, by increasing the sensitivity of GABA receptor sites. Also helpful for anxiety, insomnia, and hysteria by GABA deficiency. 
4. L-theanine- An amino acid that mimics GABA and crosses the blood-brain barrier. L-theanine actively increases GABA. 
5. Taurine- Has a molecular structure similar to GABA and impacts GABA activity. 
6. P-5-P- Necessary co-factors for the synthesis and breakdown of GABA. 
7. Magnesium- Co-factor for GABA
8. Zinc- Co-factor for GABA, especially in conjunction with p-5-p. 
9. Manganese- Supports and maintains GABA levels.
