An inhibitory neurotransmitter and amino acid that is distributed widely in the central nervous system in GABAergic neurons. GABA is synthesized from glutamic acid, catalyzed by glutamic acid and decarboxylase, an enzyme that is unique to GABAergic neurons. Following its release from presynaptic nerves and its action at the postsynaptic cell membrane. GABA can either be recycled back to the terminal or degraded by GABA transaminase to enter the citric acid cycle. Unlike the other amino acids that serve as neurotransmitters, glutamate and glycine, GABA does not have any metabolic functions.

GAD autoimmunity-The most common neuroautoimmunity creates most specific symptoms because it prevents production of GABA, which is responsible for calming the nervous system. Elevated GAD antibodies are linked to OCD, motion sickness, vertigo, autism, and “stiff man syndrome”. In addition to avoiding gluten, people with positive GAD anitbodies should also avoid foods high in artificial glutamates. An autoimmune reaction to GAD is more common among those with a gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Gluten intolerance and celiac disease should always be considered in the case of persistent symptoms of poor GABA activity.
