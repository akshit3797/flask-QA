The overall function of the parasympathetic nervous system is restorative, to conserve energy. Preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic division have their cell bodies in either the brain stem, or the sacral spinal cord. Preganglionic axons project to a series of ganglia located near or in the effector organs. The features of the parasympathetic nervous system can be noted and compared with the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system, also known as “rest and digest” system, oversees digestion, enzyme production, mucus secretion, and other related bodily activities. In terms of communication within the body, the brain constantly receives and sends information. 90% of the information the brain sends goes through an area in the lower 2/3 of the brain stem called “pontomedullary reticular formation” (PMRF). When the brain’s output travels through the PMRF on its way to deliver communication to the body, the PMRF stimulates the parasympathetic system. As a result, one experiences good digestion, good enzyme production, eyes and mouth that stay moist, good bladder and bowel control.
