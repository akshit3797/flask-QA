When the stomach produces too much acid, dyspepsia occurs. Acidity occurs when the gastric glands produce a large amount of acid, more than what is needed for the digestion process. Acid is a substance that gives off hydrogen ions, while its opposite, alkali, accepts hydrogen ions. All acids in the body contain hydrogen ions varying concentrations with stronger acids having a greater concentration of hydrogen ions. These hydrogen ions, once they become attached to various proteins, alter a proteinâ€™s structure. This is how hydrochloric acid in the stomach aids in the digestion of proteins. Hyperacidity occurs as a result of the imbalance of hydrogen ions. This condition is characterized by a burning sensation just above the stomach, or right below the breastbone.
