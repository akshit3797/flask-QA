Glucose (blood sugar) is filtered across glomerular capillaries and reabsorbed by the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. Glucose reabsorption involving Sodium glucose cotransport across the luminal membrane and facilitated glucose transport. Glucose moves from tubular fluid into the cell. The sodium gradient is maintained by K+. Glucose is transported from the cell into peritubular capillary blood by facilitated diffusion. 



<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypoglycemia</span></b><br> In healthy people, blood glucose rises after eating and then gradually falls back into the normal range. The transition occurs without notice. Should blood glucose drop below normal, a person would experience symptoms such as weakness, rapid heartbeat, sweating, anxiety, hunger, trembling. Most commonly, hypoglycemia is a consequence of poorly managed diabetes. Too much insulin, strenuous physical activity, inadequate food intake, or illness that causes blood glucose levels to plummet. It is also caused by pancreatic tumors, overuse of insulin, alcohol abuse, and uncontrolled diabetes. 


There are two root causes for the onset of diabetes: Insufficient production of the hormone insulin by the pancreas, and/or the inability of cells in the body to use insulin properly (insulin resistance).
