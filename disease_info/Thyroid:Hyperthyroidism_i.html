The most common form of hyperthyroidism is graves disease, an auto-immune disorder characterized by increased circulating levels of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins. These are antibodies to TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells. When present, the antibodies intensely stimulate the thyroid gland, resulting in increased secretion of thyroid hormones and hypertrophy of the gland. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are thyroid neoplasm, excessive secretion of TRH or TSH, and administration of excessive amounts of exogenous thyroid hormones. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on symptoms and measurement of increased levels of T3 and T4. TSH levels may be decreased or increased, depending on the cause of the hyperthyroidism. If the cause of hyperthyroidism is Gavesâ€™ disease, thyroid neoplasm or exogenous administration of the thyroid hormones, then TSH levels will be decreased by negative feedback of the high levels of T3 on the anterior pituitary. However, if the cause of hyperthyroidism is increased secretion of TRH or TSH, then TSH levels will be increased.
