1. L-arginine- At rest, oral L-arginine ingestion will enhance the growth hormone response and the combination of arginine plus exercise increases growth hormone, but this increase may be less than seen with exercise alone.

<br>*   5-9g 1x daily taken on empty stomach
<br><br>
2. Glycine- Increases Serum human growth hormone (hGH)

<br>*   8g 1x 30 minutes before bed
<br><br>
3. Desiccated pituitary- The gland of an animal will be reasonably close in its nutritional composition to that of a human being and contain most of the necessary nutrients for healthy glandular function.

<br>*   5mg 1x in morning with food
<br><br>
4. Calamus- The chemical constituents of the Calamus plant. The extract was found to inhibit antigen (purified protein derivative) stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Intracytoplasmic interferon-_γ_. 

<br>*   1,100mg 1x daily
<br><br>
5. Glutamine- Increases HGH levels

<br>*   5g 2x daily
<br><br>
6. PQQ- Maintains healthy levels of DJ-1, a protein that plays a role in antioxidant defenses in dopaminergic neurons. PQQ also supports the biosynthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF), an important signaling molecule in the brain and sensory nerves.

<br>*   10mg 1x daily
<br><br>
7. Ashwagandha- Ashwagandha supports the hypothalamus (included in the HPA axis), which regulates important functions such as hormone levels, temperature, and sleep cycles.

<br>*   1,000mg 1x daily
<br><br>
8. Vitamin E- vitamin E deficiency exerts a suppressive effect directly on the gonadal function to decrease the hormone synthesis in the Leydig cells and caused the increased secretion of pituitary LH owing to the feedback mechanism.

<br>*   400 IU 1x daily
<br><br>
9. Vitamin D- Vitamin D receptors are present in the pituitary gland. Deficiencies in this crucial vitamin will inhibit natural production for signaling communication to hormones, temperature control, TSH, and metabolism. 

<br>*   5-10,000 IU 1 daily for several weeks. Rotate every few months. Dosages vary with each individual. 
<br><br>
10. Melatonin- Influences pituitary hormone secretion; can raise vasopressin and oxytocin levels. 

<br>*   3mg 1x before bed
