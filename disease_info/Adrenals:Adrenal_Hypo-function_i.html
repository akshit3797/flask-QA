The adrenal glands are located in the retroperitoneal cavity above each cavity. The adrenal glands are 2 separate glands, the adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex, whose secretions are essential for life. When corrected for weight, these glands receive the highest blood flow of any organ in the body.

<br>Located in the inner zone of the gland, composes approximately 20% of the tissue. The adrenal medulla is of neuroectodermal origin and secretes the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine.

<br>
Located in the other zone of the gland, is of mesodermal origin and has 3 distinct layers. It composes 80% of the adrenal tissue and secretes adrenal corticosteroid hormones. The adrenal cortex differentiates by gestational week 8 and is responsible for the production of fetal adrenal steroids throughout intrauterine life. Soon after birth, the fetal adrenal cortex begins to involute, eventually disappears, and is replaced by the 3 layered adult adrenal cortex. The androgens in the adrenal cortex are DHEA and androstenedione.

<br>
The adrenal cortex secretes 3 classes of steroid hormones: Glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens. The precursor for all adrenocortical steroids is cholesterol. Cholesterol desmolase is the rate-limiting pathway, and it is stimulated by ACTH.

Primary adrenocortical insufficiency is commonly caused by autoimmune destruction of all zones of the adrenal cortex. There is decreased ACTH, which then decreases cortisol secretion where there is decreased synthesis of all adrenocortical hormones, resulting in decreased circulating levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens.
