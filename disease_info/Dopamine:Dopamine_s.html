1. L-Tyrosine- Precursor for dopamine and norepinephrine. 
<br><br>
2. Phosphatidylserine- Increases number of receptor sites in the brain. Protects damage to the hippocampus and stimulates the release of dopamine. Restores nerve cell membranes.
<br><br>
3. Mucuna pruriens- Contains high amounts of leva dopa- a precursor for dopamine.
<br><br>
4. DL-phenylalanine- Converted to tyrosine in the liver, then crosses the blood brain barrier where it is then used for catecholamine synthesis.
<br><br>
5. Rhodiola- Increases dopamine and serotonin sensitivity.
<br><br>
6. DMAE- Prevents choline uptake by cells forcing more free choline to be available in your system and stimulates cholinergic receptors that may promote synthesis of acetylcholine_ _in your brain.
<br><br>
7. Bacopa monnieri- Enhances the rate at which the nervous system can communicate by increasing the growth of nerve endings (dendrites). It is also a strong antioxidant for the brain. 
<br><br>
8. Gotu Kola- Helps protect blood vessels that supply oxygen to the brain. Improves memory and concentration as well.
<br><br>
9. CDP-choline- 
<br><br>
10. SAM-e- Functions closely with folic acid and vitamin B12 in methylation reactions. Methylation reactions are critical in the manufacture of brain chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. It improves binding of neurotransmitters to receptor sites, which causes increased serotonin and dopamine activity and improved brain cell membrane fluidity.
